# Diabetes-Rl-Insulin-Control-Ai--Project
This project implements a Q-Learning based Reinforcement Learning system for diabetes management. A custom environment simulates glucose dynamics influenced by insulin actions, meals, and exercise. The agent learns optimal insulin adjustments to keep blood glucose within a safe range while handling noise and variability.
